Bare with the code it is done in short period of time with unexperienced cs student in machine learning for a thesis study.

(in addition, it is done during last year when there are consecutive typhoon landed in the Philippines, resulting on frequent internet interruptions)

the code in this repo are combination of yolo11 vehicle detection model for vehicle detection and counting.
then, the output from the counting of vehicle (traffic volume) was used as a dataset for traffic forecasting to prove that
an LSTM with attention mechanism is better than regular LSTM. The compared Time-Series models are LSTM, LSTM with Attention, 
and Bidirectional-LSTM with Attention.
